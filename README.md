This is the WeatherFlow Poly for the [Universal Devices ISY994i](https://www.universal-devices.com/residential/ISY) [Polyglot interface](http://www.universal-devices.com/developers/polyglot/docs/) with  [Polyglot V2](https://github.com/Einstein42/udi-polyglotv2) or [Polisy](https://www.universal-devices.com/product/polisy/)

This node server is intended to support the [WeatherFlow Smart Weather Station](http://www.weatherflow.com/).


## Version 2.0 notice
Version 2 is a major update with changes to the configuration options and 
how the node server operates. The device serial numbers are used to select
which device data to report. Also, support has been added for the new,
soon to be released Tempest weather station.

## Installation

1. Backup Your ISY in case of problems!
   * Really, do the backup, please
2. Go to the Polyglot Store in the UI and install.
3. From the Polyglot menu, Add NodeServer in Polyglot Web
4. From the Polyglot dashboard, select WeatherFlow node server and configure (see configuration options below).
5. Once configured, the WeatherFlow node server should update the ISY with the proper nodes and begin filling in the node data. Note that it can take up to 1 minute for data to appear.
6. Restart the Admin Console so that it can properly display the new node server nodes.

### Node Settings
The settings for this node are:

#### Short Poll
   * Not used
#### Long Poll
   * Sends a heartbeat as DON/DOF
#### Station
   * The WeatherFlow station ID.
#### ListenPort
   * Port to listen on for WeatherFlow data. Default is port 50222.
#### Sky/Air/Tempest Serial Numbers
   * Specifies the specific sensor devices to monitor. Currently only one
     station can be monitored. This may be a station with a single Air and a
	 Single Sky or a station with a single Tempest.
#### AGL
   * Height of the Air or Tempest above ground level.
#### Elevation
   * Elevation of the location where the station is sited.
#### Units
   * Display data in either 'metric', 'US', or 'UK' units.


## Requirements

1. Polyglot V2 itself should be run on Raspian Stretch.
  To check your version, ```cat /etc/os-release``` and the first line should look like
  ```PRETTY_NAME="Raspbian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch)"```. It is possible to upgrade from Jessie to
  Stretch, but I would recommend just re-imaging the SD card.  Some helpful links:
   * https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspbian-stretch/
   * https://linuxconfig.org/raspbian-gnu-linux-upgrade-from-jessie-to-raspbian-stretch-9
2. ISY firmware 5.0.x or later.

# Upgrading

Open the Polyglot web page, go to nodeserver store and click "Update" for "WeatherFlow".

Then restart the WeatherFlow nodeserver by selecting it in the Polyglot dashboard and select Control -> Restart, then watch the log to make sure everything goes well.

The WeatherFlow nodeserver keeps track of the version number and when a profile rebuild is necessary.  The profile/version.txt will contain the WeatherFlow profile_version which is updated in server.json when the profile should be rebuilt.
